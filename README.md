------ Real-time validation and error messaging ------
The "name," "email," and all "credit card" number fields are programmed for
real-time validation and error messaging through the "realTimeValidate" and
"blurValidate" functions

------ Conditional Error Messaging--------------------
All text fields have conditional error messaging built into both the real-
time error validation as well as the validation that triggers upon form
submission, depending on the problem with the input.
